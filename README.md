# PythonLibrary2MCP

## Description
The purpose of this tool is to provide a simple way to port functions of existing Python 
libraries (both built-in and external) as MCP (Model Context Protocol) server tools.

The tool is based on the [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) library, and acts as an
added layer on top.

## Usage
The libraries must already be installed.
Note that the functions that will be attached as MCP tools, are all the routines within the 
specified module.
